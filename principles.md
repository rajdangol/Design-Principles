Make It Work; Make It Right; Make It Fast

#Minimise Coupling
Apply law of demeter
Don't talk to strangers

#Composition over Inheritance
A class that offers its services primarily through Inheritance is basically saying 
“to use my services you can’t just hire me, you must become me” .

Hollywood Principle - "Don't call us, we will call you" (LOL)
